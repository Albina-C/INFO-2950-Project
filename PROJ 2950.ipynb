    "# I. Research Question\n",
    "#### Is there a relationship in how happy a country is and the music the people of this country listen to?"
   ]
  },

    "### Introduction\n",
    "Attempting to understand what makes a country \"happy\" is often attributable to freedom, social support, life expectancy, health, among others. However, the music the people of said country listen to is often not one of these factors given its weak relationship and versatility across the world. Although our research question does not attempt to attribute the type of music a country listens to to its happiness index score (it would be difficult to establish given reverse causality), we are more interested in observing what trends are apparent in some of the happiest and less happiest countries with respect to the music they listen to. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some additional questions that we are seeking to answer...\n",
    "- What songs are there (if any) that are popular in all countries regardless of happiness rank?\n",
    "- Are there genres/styles of music that are consistent with \"happy\" countries? With \"sad\" countries? For example, can we expect happy countries to listen to more pop music than sad ones?\n",
    "- What are the characteristics of songs that are popular in happy countries? Fast or slow tempo? Live vocals or autotune?\n",
    "- Can we find more instances of happy songs in sad countries than sad songs in happy countries?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The datasets we will be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "All the datasets were found on Kaggle.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. [\"World Happiness Report 2017\"](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness) by Sustainable Development Solutions Network\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The Sustainable Development Solutions Network ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, and calculates a \"happiness score\" for each country using six factors: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. This dataset is for the year 2017.\n",
    "2. [\"Spotify's Worldwide Daily Song Ranking\"](https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking) by Kaggle user\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For each country in 54 countries, this dataset provides the top 200 songs per day in the year of 2017 (January 1, 2017 to January 9, 2018). \n",
    "- *Note: the Kaggle description says 53 countries, but we found 54 countries. Perhaps the description was not updated when the dataset was.*\n",
    "3. [\"Spotify Web API\"](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This dataset contains contains characteristics of songs on Spotify. Spotify calculates and gives scores for their songs. Some of these values include scores for danceability, beats per minute (bpm), and liveness (the likeliness that the song is a live recording)."

    "1) What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)? The observations are countries and the attributes are as stated above. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Why was this dataset created? This dataset was originally created by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and posted on Kaggle. The purpose of this dataset was to explore these questions:\n",
    "    - What countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness? \n",
    "    - How did country ranks or scores change between the 2015 and 2016 as well as the 2016 and 2017 reports? \n",
    "    - Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Who funded the creation of the dataset? The Sustainable Development Solutions Network is part of the UN, so we can assume that the creation of this dataset was funded by the United Nations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not? While Gallup has a very thorough methodology when it comes to carrying out the Gallup World Poll (which provides the data that is used to calculate the happiness scores and rankings), there are still chances that people are not honest when they answer the question, or that the poll is not reaching a large/diverse enough group. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using? The SDSN did a lot of preprocessing since we believe they are the ones who took the data from the Gallup World Poll and calculated all of the happiness data. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for? The happiness scores are calculated using data that is collected through the Gallup World Poll. The people who answer these questions are aware of the data collection. This is a well-known report that is compiled, however, we are unsure if they are aware of the purpose of the survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data (hosted in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box).  This is the link to the dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle by the SDSN: https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness"

    "1) Given we are dealing with a relatively sample of only 2017, albeit with 50 songs per day, drawing conclusions for what type of music a happy or unhappy country listens may not prove out to be as accurate as we would like it to be. We can say, however, that the culture of a country likely does not vary signficantly from one year to another, so the top genres and happy scores may reflect of the country's values to an extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Some countries were omitted in order to be able to use the countries in the happiness index and those in our spotify data. In order to draw some observations, we had to find overlap in songs. This may naturally produce bias since some potentially happy countries with potentially signficant relationships to music will completely be overlooked due to availability of data. This concerns mainly the overarching/big picture of happy countries and certain genres being more common.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) We are relying on audio features scores for specific songs provided by a dataset. It is possible this dataset contains subjective information to the user, hence the genres and danceability scores may not reflect the names the people of the country would utilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Certain countries use other streaming services opposed to Spotify. For example, Japan uses has it's own streaming service that is more popular than Spotify. Therefore, we techinically aren't getting the most popular songs of reach country, but rather the most popular songs offered on Spotify for each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) We removed over half of the countries on the Happiness Index. Therefore when we begin to categorize countries as \"sad\", they may not actually be very \"sad\" in comparison to the countries we removed. It will be important for us to look at the scores as well as the ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) We are are comparing happiness from 2017, which is about 4 years ago. Trends in music have changed and we need to understand what is popular now is different from what it was back then."
