    "Attempting to understand what makes a country \"happy\" is often attributable to freedom, social support, life expectancy, health, among others. However, the music the people of said country listen to is often not one of these factors given its weak relationship and versatility across the world. Although our research question does not attempt to attribute the type of music a country listens to to its happiness index score (it would be difficult to establish given reverse causality), we are more interested in observing what trends are apparent in some of the happiest and less happiest countries with respect to the music they listen to. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is no surprise that music is widely used as coping mechanism for any form of distress by most individuals across the world. Neuroscientists have attributed songs like \"Don't Stop Me Now\" by Queen and \"Dancing Queen\" by Abba as some of the happiest songs. Indeed, Spotify has thousands of playlists with titles like \"Happy Days,\" \"Happy Hits,\" Just Smile Happy Songs,\" and \"Happy Songs to Sing in The Car\" with the goal of increasing mental health awareness and  \n",

    "- What songs are there (if any) that are popular in all countries regardless of happiness rank?\n",
    "- Are there genres/styles of music that are consistent with \"happy\" countries? With \"sad\" countries? For example, can we expect happy countries to listen to more pop music than sad ones?\n",
    "- What are the characteristics of songs that are popular in happy countries? Fast or slow tempo? Live vocals or autotune?\n",
    "- Can we find more instances of happy songs in sad countries than sad songs in happy countries?\"\n",

    "# II Data Description <a name=\"dd\"></a>\n",
    "The two datasets we used from Kaggle were a Spotify dataset that compiled the daily top songs from January 2017 to January 2018 for each country and a dataset that compiled the happiness scores and ranks by country. \n",
    "\n",
    "**World Happiness Report Dataset**<br>\n",
    "<br>The happiness score dataset’s rows are the countries that were included in the Gallup World Poll; its columns are country, happiness score, happiness rank, GDP per capita, family, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, government corruption, and dystopia residual. Factors such as GDP per capita, freedom, etc. are used to compute a country’s happiness score, and then their rank once their score is viewed in relation to other countries. \n",
    "<br>Much of the data for the world happiness reports comes from the Gallup World Poll. This poll conducts randomized telephone or face-to-face interviews depending on the percentage of a country’s population that has a telephone (cite). The world happiness report is usually published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, a branch of the United Nations. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network uploaded the data set for 2015-2019 onto Kaggle. We only use the 2017 dataset. According to the Kaggle dataset, the inspiration for this dataset was to discover the answers to questions like, “What countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness?”, “How did country ranks or scores change between the 2015 and 2016 as well as the 2016 and 2017 reports?”,  “Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness?” (cite). Since this dataset is published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, we can assume that the United Nations funded the creation of this dataset – or at least the data within it.\n",
    "<br>While Gallup has a very thorough methodology when it comes to carrying out the Gallup World Poll there is still the possibility that people are not honest when they answer the question, or that the poll is not reaching a large/diverse enough group. Additionally, the data that is collected through this poll is affected by the type of person who typically responds to polling questions; for example, people who have very strong opinions about the topic are more likely to agree to be polled than those who have weaker opinions. This may skew the responses to the data. \n",
    "<br>To compile this dataset, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network had to take the data from the world happiness reports (which have separate reports for each year) and append the poll data into the necessary columns for each country. This required the Sustainable Development Solutions Network to pick and choose the data in the actual world happiness report that they believed was important to include in the Kaggle dataset. \n",
    "The happiness scores are calculated using data that is collected through the Gallup World Poll. The people who answer these questions are aware of the data collection. This is a well-known report that is compiled, however, we are unsure if they are aware of the purpose of the survey.\n",
    "This is the link to the dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle by the SDSN: https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness \n",
    "\n",
    "**Spotify Dataset**<br>\n",
    "<br>Each row of this dataset contains a ranking position on a specific day for a song. The columns represent different features of these songs, including position, track name, artist, streams, URL, date, and region. It should be noted that this dataset contains 200 top songs for a given day for 53 countries, which are represented by abbreviated regions.\n",
    "<br>This dataset was created to identify trends among certain groups of songs within different regions, which would theoretically allow people to predict specific ranks of songs and their respective streams in Spotify. The API, thus, was intended for observing potential  correlations between the data. \n",
    "<br>A Kaggle user whose name is Eduardo created this dataset. He is said to be a Software Engineer based in France for the company BlaBlaCar. It is likely the user may have excluded some songs out of this dataset whose information was not entirely present, or that had some data missing. In particular, the user explains the data was missing on a few occasions, so some countries may not have 200 songs for each day from 2017-2018 due to missing data. Thus, only the songs from Spotify that were available at the time of the web-scraping were added to the dataset. The creator of this dataset web-scraped the Spotify charts and we downloaded the Kaggle CSV File of this dataset in order to obtain the information for the songs. No users besides Eduardo were involved in the process according to the specifications of the dataset.\n",

    "# III Pre-registration Statements <a name=\"pre\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The two analyses that we have chosen to perform in our final project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the relationship between the happiness score of a country and the average danceability score of its top songs over two-week periods for a year?\n",
    "2. What is the relationship between the happiness score of a country and the average valence score of its top songs over two-week periods for a year?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Analysis #1**<br> Does the danceability of a song have any correlation with the happiness score of a country?\n",
    "For our first analysis, we will be performing the rolling average of two weeks (14 days) for our data frame. In sum, this rolling average will take the average danceability score over 14 days by collecting the 50 songs for this period for the top happiest and bottom happiest countries. In particular, we believe there may be a relationship between those countries that score high in the happiness rank and those countries with songs that have high danceability scores. Danceability is often correlated with happiness, hence we believe the top ten [happiest] countries may exhibit particularly high danceability scores. The goal of our project is to understand whether there is any meaningful relationship between happy countries and the music they listen to. As a result, performing a rolling average of the danceability scores of the top happiest and least happy countries will allow us to observe one dimension of happiness from the lenses of danceability. As stated, we expect to see the top happiest countries (e.g., Norway and Iceland) to have high danceability rolling average scores compared to the least happy countries (e.g., Honduras and Portugal).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis #2** <br>Can we predict the happiness ranking of a country based on Spotify-provided happiness scores (“valence”)?\n",
    "For every song, the Spotify API provides its own “happiness” score, called “valence.” The higher the valence score, the more positive mood for the song. Using these provided happiness scores, we want to compare the valence for popular songs in sad countries and popular songs in happy countries. If happy countries do have higher valence scores than sad ones, we may find a relevant connection between happiness ranks and the valence scores. If sad countries have higher valence scores than happy countries, we may still be able to find a connection between the variables and presume that sad countries may want to listen to happier songs. Even if there is no significant difference between the valence scores between happy and sad countries, we can still analyze the results and conduct more outside research as to why there is no correlation. This may be related to other Spotify-provided scores, such as “danceability”. Some countries, perhaps Hispanic ones, may have dance built into their cultures even though the happiness scores are variable. All in all, we may find that Spotify’s valence score does not accurately indicate happiness.\n"

    "# IV Data Analysis <a name=\"da1\"></a>\n",
    "**Evaluation of significance**<br>\n",
    "We used various techniques to analyze our data, but our main analysis consisted of a linear regression model to predict happiness score for 2020 based on data we trained from 2017. Specifically, we focused on using certain features (danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, and duration_ms) as our predictor variables and our happiness score as our outcome variable. Doing a linear regression model was appropriate for our model because we had already done the correlation of some of these features and happiness score, which all resulted in insignificant results. Therefore, modeling the relationship between happiness score and these features seemed most adequate by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. This was also in line with our hypothesis asserting a positive relationship between happiness score and these features (i.e., we expected our top ten countries to have a positive, quasi-linear relationship between happiness score and some of these features, and the opposite with our bottom ten countries).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "It should be noted that we deemed correlation appropriate – and consequently linear regression – after having completed the rolling average of these top and bottom ten countries for a window of 14 days of Spotify songs’ features. We observed virtually no relationship between some of our features like danceability and valence – whose graphs support this conclusion – and happiness score, hence we resorted to other methods of potentially evaluating this relationship. As it pertains to our reasoning behind deciding to run a rolling average, we wanted to understand the possibility of there being a relationship between happiness score and individual features over fourteen days. A rolling, or moving, average analyzes data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of a full data set, which seemed appropriate for our purposes since we were working with a dataset of ~50 countries for one year. Although we acknowledge that it would have been more compelling to evaluate a rolling average over a longer period [beyond fourteen days], this was impractical given time constraints. We attempted to do this, and the calculation took over three hours; further, the Spotify API – which we are using to obtain all the features for our Spotify songs – could only be run a specific number of times before we got a timing error. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Our correlation scores indicated there was no strong positive relationship between happiness score and each feature. Our strongest correlation (0.35)  was that between happiness score and duration_ms, which was a trivial feature for our analysis. Nevertheless, we observed slightly more positive correlations when it came to happiness rank (note: this is not the same as happiness score) and liveness (0.7), which prompted us to try the rolling average of individual features and consequently try a linear regression model. Concerning our linear regression training model, our coefficients for all features were insignificant. Nearly all of our coefficients equaled zero, except for some features like \"acousticness\" and \"liveness\", which still produced results <0.03.\n",
    "<br><br><br>\n",
    "**Interpretation and conclusions** <a name=\"da2\"></a>\n",
    "Upon having run a linear regression model to predict happiness score for 2020 by training 2017 data – specifically, some of the Spotify features–  our coefficients (which determines the direction of the relationship between our predictor and outcome) were 0 or close to 0. Further, we conducted a rolling average of two of these Spotify features for songs over two weeks for the top and bottom 10 countries in 2017, and our results indicated that there was no significant relationship between happiness score and these Spotify features. As such, we can only conclude that the selected features for Spotify are not a good predicting tool for a country’s happiness, as determined by its happiness score.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "We predicted a country’s happiness score could be predicted by the type of music the people of that country listen to. Specifically, we thought features like how danceable a song is would ultimately give us more insight into the overall happiness of people from this country – irrespective of social or political factors affecting this score. Following conventional wisdom, we believed features like danceability, valence, instrumentalism, and liveness were representative of happiness. However, our results indicate precisely the opposite, thus making these features unfit for determining a country’s happiness. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Without prior knowledge about this potential relationship between a country’s happiness and these Spotify features, analysts could potentially predict a country’s general happiness using features like liveness and danceability. This can be seen as a useful metric for this purpose, given the ability of music to uplift or distress people, which would be generalized to the entire population of certain countries. In particular, we often associate music with mood, given the ability of music to stimulate certain emotions or sensations. A prediction of this sort would theoretically impulse policy-makers – or anyone striving for the overall well-being of a given country – to implement measures and activities using music. Countries ranking low on their happiness score would attempt to assimilate to the music followings of higher-ranking countries on their happiness score. As it relates, pursuing a goal like this is not indicative of a country’s happiness and will likely produce a negligible effect on the country’s happiness. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Notwithstanding, there may be positive outcomes in following through with this approach. Although this would require further research on the subject matter, the exposure to “happy” music – as determined by high scores of danceability, or other similar features – can improve the well-being and emotional state of people.  Indeed, authors writing on behalf of the American Psychological Association studied precisely this relationship in 2010, asserting that “happiness ratings were elevated for fast-tempo and major key-stimuli and sadness ratings were elevated for slow-tempo and minor-key stimuli'' (Hunter). A different relationship may be observed in a longer period than 14 weeks, but this would require the use of more developed tools beyond only using the Spotify API, given the constraints it poses."

    "# V Data Limitations <a name=\"lims\"></a>\n",
    "When conducting this analysis, our group used only the top ten and bottom ten happiest countries, due to the limit on the number of calls you can make to the Spotify API. This limits our data size because we excluded the rest of the countries that are included within the happiness data. This affects our data by not only limiting it but also excluding countries with different cultures and the trends within that nation. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Using data from 2017 further limits our data set because it is not up-to-date. We recognize that within our analysis that the cultures of the countries that we selected are not varying significantly, so we assumed that the type of music listened to within the different countries would not differ greatly. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the music platform Spotify in itself for this analysis is another limitation because it excludes the other music platforms that may be more popular in different countries. Japan serves as a prime example of this limitation coming into play because Japan does not use Spotify as much as other countries. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While attempting to extract information from the Spotify API, our group came across issues with the security of Spotify. When re-running our code, there would be errors yielded which stated that we used our maximum amounts of retries. To mitigate this issue, we had to install a Spotify extension for our use. Additionally, Spotify installed an extra layer of security on their Spotify charts website, which hindered our ability to web-scrape the data for 2020. We were able to get 2020 data, however, some days may be missing for certain countries.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Another limitation our group recognized was that music listened to globally became more versatile in that people of different nationalities are listening to international music, due to trends. This change might not be reflected within our data analysis because, once again, we are working with data from 2017. "

The function **first_fifty** is subsetting the information of our selected countries by only taking the top fifty songs for each day. The function **not18** is subsetting the information of our selected countries by only taking observations from the year 2017 – excluding 2018. The function **cleancol** is changing column names to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores; this will facilitate our use of certain Pandas function later in our analyses."

With respect to valence, however, there appears to be a wider range of valence scores that are covered by the songs these top countries listen to. As such, this may be a fruitless metric in attempting to understand the music these top countries listen to. This would imply valence scores largely vary by song, contrary to danceability, which is more uniform."

    "<p> There appears to be a more linear relationship between the danceability and valence scores and the 10 bottom happiest countries. By the same token, some of the lowest ranking countries – in terms of happiness– have relatively high danceability scores, as in the case of Honduras and the Dominican Republic. These, however, can be interpreted as potential anomalies given the other countries do not show a similar pattern. Given that there is a wide range of danceability and valence scores for these countries, we can fairly conclude there is no notable relationship between the danceability and valence and the happiness score of a country. We are still under the assumption a two-week period is sufficient to draw larger conclusions for the overall musical trend of the country. All in all, the rolling average of the top and bottom 10 countries highlights there is no meaningful relationship between how happy a country is and how danceable the music the people of these countries listen to. As it pertains to our research question, this supports the argument that there is no particular relationship between how happy a country is and the danceability and valence of its music. Other features, however, may be at play – independent of danceability and valence – to still assess the signficiance of music on a country's overall happiness rank.<p>\n",

    "At a first glance, we observe no meaningful relationship between the top 10 countries and the bottom 10 countries as it relates to how danceable the songs these countries listen to are. However, there appears to be a notable trend for the top 10 countries in that the danceability score remains above 0.60 despite there being a decrease at ~7.3 and ~7.5. In comparing both top and bottom 10 countries, however, we cannot draw a truly significant relationship given that many countries from the bottom 10 have relatively high danceability scores – in particular at ~5.3 and ~5.5 – as those danceability scores from the top 10 countries. Additionally, it is worth noting that many of the bottom 10 countries with happiness scores in the range ~5.6-7.3 have constant danceability scores ranging from ~0.63-0.67. We assume this can be due to a commitment to specific, potentially esoteric genres in some countries. In other words, some of these \"mildly\" happy countries enjoy specific genres, and thus their people listen primarily only to these countries, which coincidentally happen to have \"mildly\" danceable scores."

    "3. We plan on not using the Spotify Kaggle data sets for the final project, so some of the data description questions will not be applicable. How should we go about answering these questions when we construct our dataset?\n",
