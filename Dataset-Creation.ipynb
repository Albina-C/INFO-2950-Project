    "# Dataset Creation\n",
    "For our final project, we spent a substantial amount of time creating our datasets `spotify2019` and\n",
    "`spotify2020`. First, we web scraped 40 of the [official Spotify top 200 chart webpages](https://spotifycharts.com/regional). Second, we used the Spotify API to gain Spotify-generated audio features of the songs we scraped from the charts. These audio features are numeric scores that rate a song's feature, such as danceability, valence, or loudness. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents our process of generating these datasets, explaining the code we wrote and the setbacks we faced.\n",

    "### 1. Introduction: Why did we decide to make our own dataset?\n",
    "#### Research Question: Is there a relationship between how happy a country is and the music the people of this country listen to?\n",
    "When we first asked our main research question at the start of the semester we had planned on using this dataset on Kaggle: [Spotify's Worldwide Daily Song Ranking (2017)](https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking).\n",
    "It contains the top 200 streamed songs per day each for 54 countries (almost 4,000,000 observations!), directly taken from the [official Spotify Charts website](https://spotifycharts.com/regional). This was the only dataset that we could find containing the top songs of several countries on Spotify.<br><br>\n",
    "While we did begin to work with this Kaggle dataset, after becoming more comfortable with pandas and learning about web scraping, we decided that we could make a dataset from the charts ourselves that better suited our research question. By having access to later years' song data (not only 2017), we would be able to answer our research question with more relevant conclusions and do more statistical analyses. For example, in our final project we train a model using 2019 song data to predict a country's happiness score in 2020."
