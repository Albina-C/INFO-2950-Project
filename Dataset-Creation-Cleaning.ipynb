    "# Dataset Creation & Cleaning\n",
    "For our final project, we spent a substantial amount of time creating our datasets `spotify2019` and\n",
    "`spotify2020`. First, we web scraped 40 of the [official Spotify top 200 chart webpages](https://spotifycharts.com/regional). Second, we used the Spotify API to gain Spotify-generated audio features of the songs we scraped from the charts. These audio features are numeric scores that rate a song's feature, such as danceability, valence, or loudness. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents our process of generating these datasets, explaining the code we wrote and the setbacks we faced.\n",

    "#### Research Question: Is there a relationship between how happy a country is and the music the people of this country listen to?\n",
    "When we first asked our main research question at the start of the semester we had planned on using this dataset on Kaggle: [Spotify's Worldwide Daily Song Ranking (2017)](https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking).\n",
    "It contains the top 200 streamed songs per day each for 54 countries (almost 4,000,000 observations!), directly taken from the [official Spotify Charts website](https://spotifycharts.com/regional). This was the only dataset that we could find containing the top songs of several countries on Spotify.<br><br>\n",
    "While we did begin to work with this Kaggle dataset, after becoming more comfortable with pandas and learning about web scraping, we decided that we could make a dataset from the charts ourselves that better suited our research question. By having access to later years' song data (not only 2017), we would be able to answer our research question with more relevant conclusions and do more statistical analyses. For example, in our final project we train a model using 2019 song data to predict a country's happiness score in 2020."

    "In order to access the top songs for a certain country on the Spotify Charts website, a user has to select the country from the drop-down menu, which loads a new page. The day that the user is looking at also loads a new page. Therefore, looking at a certain country's top songs for an entire year would generate around 365 links. Since we looked at 20 countries for both 2019 and 2020, we needed 365 links for 40 countries. Defining functions that created and saved these links helped simplify this process. After looping through each link for a country, we were able to get the information listed on each page that a link was connected to.\n",

    "Once we defined all of our functions, it was time to actually call the functions on each country. Instead of using a for-loop to call `get_table(link)` and `track_artist(df)` on all of the countries in `happy2019` and `happy2020`, we manually ran all of these functions on the 40 countries. We did this in order to run our functions on multiple countries at once, using different kernels. We also print the links since sometimes the webscraper would crash at a random date. Printing the links would let us see where the webscraper stopped, and then modify our the dates for which we were webscraping. \n",
